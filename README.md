# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains all coding assignments, projects, and challenges completed as part of my JavaScript course. It serves as a central hub to organize and showcase my progress and skills in JavaScript development.

## Repository Structure

Each project will have its own folder, containing:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Any assets such as images or data files
- Instructions or notes on how to run the project
- Screenshots or demos (if applicable)

## Purpose

- Track my learning progress in JavaScript
- Maintain a portfolio of completed projects
- Share code with instructors and potential employers
- Practice good version control using Git and GitHub

## Guidelines

- Code will be regularly pushed to GitHub
- Projects will not be deleted unless explicitly instructed
- Each commit will include clear messages describing the changes

Thank you for visiting my repository! Feel free to explore the projects and leave feedback if needed.
